    - Using the readme as a place for commenting on blog posts.
* Race as a high impact predictor reflections.

Thank you for reflecting on this article in your Learning Journal. I have selected not quite randomly a variety of thoughts and opinions from the class on each of these prompts and posted them on [[Week 8 pages]](https://data485.netlify.app/wk08-notes.html). My goal is to share out informally the wide perspectives that even this small class contains.
