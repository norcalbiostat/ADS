# NSC Poster Session 

* [[Schedule]](https://www.csuchico.edu/nsci/event/poster.shtml)
* Setup your poster in the morning.
* Dress is business casual. Roughly that means a nice shirt and jeans. Shorts are okay (it is hot) but not like gym shorts. 
* At least one person needs to be at your poster between 12:20-2:30. 
    - It would be ideal if at least one person could also be at the awards ceremony from 3-3:30pm
