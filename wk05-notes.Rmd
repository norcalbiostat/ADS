# Housekeeping 

* Thank you for patience & understanding with me missing class last week.
* If you get no/partial credit for an assignment that you want to redo or complete you can do so but then send me a link directly in Discord to the thing to review and an explanation of what it is you want me to regrade. 
    - This could be a URL to hackmd, or a repo, with a specific line number. 
    - The burden to minimize my effort in finding and regrading your late work is on you, since it's late.

## It's easier than you may think

It's amazing how many jobs want you to know SQL, and how comparatively EASY it is to learn once you know dplyr.
